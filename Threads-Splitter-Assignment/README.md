# Threads Splitter Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate multi-threaded code execution. In my project, I developed a method that creates a text file, splits that file into 4 seperate smaller files, equally, and then obtains the word count of each, simultaneously. Those 4 values are returned to the terminal for the user to see. The file creation method allows for variability in the generation of strings in the file.
The main purpose of the program is to simulate dynamic code execution with a high potential of collision to occur during process execution.
