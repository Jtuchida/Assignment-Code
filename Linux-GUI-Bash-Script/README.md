# SecBash
This Bash script provides a suite of Linux terminal commands for security and system management. (giving access to specific vital security checks)

This script was developed by students new to Linux, learning the ropes.
The objective was to dive into the Linux system and understand some of the key factors in hardening Linux systems and create a method of easily creating a system to leverage and automate these commands.
This provides a basic understanding of some of the many commands used in managing different operational and security components of the Linux OS.

What has been created here is a way for those who are still new to the Linux OS to be able to run basic security checks on their existing or new system to determine what security is required to be fortified. By creating a makeshift GUI different options are given to run a variety of system scans, display operation commands, and also anti-malware protocols to possibly detect any hidden malware on the system. 

This script also provides a basic understanding of the fundamentals of creating a GUI inside of Bash. This GUI is used to navigate the different commands used within the program.
Each option is labeled to its purpose and runs commands and protocols automatically ensuring that the operation is done correctly leaving less worry (when it comes to new users looking to grow their understanding of Linux)

The script is not only able to be transported and used on any given Linux system, at any given time, but also can be modified very easily to achieve any operations a more seasoned user may be inclined to use on their system. While this project is a first-time development and proof of concept, i.e. to simulate other GUIs for security protocols as other OSs, like Windows with "Windows Defender Firewall", it has been made to be modular and simple to take apart and understand.
